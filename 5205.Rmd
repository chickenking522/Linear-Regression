#The simple linear regression model seems appropriate,since average minutes
#of service time appears to be a linear function of number of copiers serviced.


#(b)
ls.fit <- lm(minutes ~ copiers, data=Data)
abline(ls.fit, lty=2)
summary(ls.fit)
#Hence the regression line is Y^=-0.5802+15.0352x,the estimated regression function
#fit good to the data.


#(c)The service time increases b1 = 15.0352 minutes by each copier services. 

#(d)b0 = -0.5802 maybe the starting time,which is the time before works.

#(e)estimate of the mean service time for calls with x = 5 copiers by 
#Y^=0.5802+15.0352(5)=74.596 minutes

#(f)predict of the service time for a single call with  x = 5 copiers by 
#Y^=0.5802+15.0352(5)=74.596 minutes

#yes,the simple linear regression model seems appropriate for these data.
#Because the annual crime rate appears to be a linear function of the percentage of
#individuals which has at least a high-school diploma.

#(b)
ls.fit <- lm(y ~ x, data=Data)

summary(ls.fit)
#regression line is Y^=20517.60-170.58x

#(c)
#(i) High-school graduation rates lower by 5 percentage points  will have
#a higher crime rate by 5(170.58) = 853 crimes per 100,000.

#(ii)Estimation of the crime rate for a county with an 80% high-school 
#graduation rate will be 20517.60 - 170.58(80)= 6872 crimes per 100,000.

#(iii)
Data[6,]
#So the random error term for the sixth county is e6 =9100 - [20517.60 - 170.58(66)]
#= -159.64.

#MSE(Risk) = 2.638, MSE(AFS) = 3.221 and MSE(Xray) =3.147. Risk leads to
#the smallest variability around the fitted regression line.This result is
#apparent from plots in parts(a) and (b).
